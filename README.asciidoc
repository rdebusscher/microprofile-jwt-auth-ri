A reference implementation for the microprofile-jwt-auth specification work

1/8/2017 : principal module (jwt-auth-principal-ri) Rework from original code by Scott Stark.
Idea is to remove dependency on KeyCloak at runtime.
It may evolve in a separate RI or can be merged back to original repo.
Changed the license header of the files which are heavily changed.

1/8/2017 : Java EE security API dependency only for 'JSR375 RI'
